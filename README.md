# Slime Them All

Welcome to Slime Them All, a 1v1 physics-based fighting game where you play a squishy scaling slime. The objective? Ejecting your opponent in the void, a total of 3 times. The first one to get ejected 3 times loses. But there is a catch: when you get bumped into, you lose slime and size. The smaller you get, the easier it is to eject you. But small slimes also have their own assets...
